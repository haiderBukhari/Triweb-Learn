## 1) HTML 📝

- **HTML Form and Table** ✍️
  - In this section, I crafted an HTML form and table as part of my internship journey to establish a strong foundation, ensuring a smoother path for the adventures that lie ahead.


## 2) CSS 🎨

- **CSS Time Table** 📅
  - In this section, I applied CSS to refine my web elements as a vital step in my internship journey, laying a solid groundwork for the exciting path that lies ahead.

## 3) JavaScript 🚀

- **JavaScript Problems** 💡
  - JavaScript powers the web, and here, I've tackled diverse programming challenges on Leetcode to grasp ad many skills as possible. In this section I learned alont involving functions, loops, conditionals, and data structures.


## 4) ES6 🚀

- **ES6 Problems** 🌟
  - ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) brings JavaScript to the next level. I have gained hands-on experience with ES6 syntax and its features, such as arrow functions, template literals, destructuring assignments for both objects and arrays, the spread operator, classes for object-oriented programming, and the powerful 'let' and 'const' variable declarations. This strong foundation in ES6 has equipped me with the modern JavaScript skills necessary to tackle more advanced programming tasks in the future.


## 5) MySQL 📊

- **MySQL** 🗃️
  - As Databases are a backbone of web apps. I have acquired a solid understanding of MySQL, a popular relational database management system, during my learning journey. This includes mastering essential concepts such as creating and managing databases, designing and optimizing database schemas.

## 6) Node JS project using MY SQL DATABASE 🌐

In this node js project I showcases CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with MySQL. This project is designed to help better understand the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern and the Request-Response model in web development.

### Project Overview

This project serves as a practical example of building a web application using Node.js and MySQL, focusing on separation of concerns and efficient handling of HTTP requests and responses.

### Key Features

- **MVC Architecture**: Gain a deep understanding of the MVC design pattern, which divides your application into models, views, and controllers for better organization and maintainability.

- **MySQL Database**: Learn how to integrate and interact with a MySQL database to store and manage user data effectively.

- **CRUD Operations**: Explore how to perform CRUD operations on user records, covering the basics of database interactions.

- **Express.js for Routing**: Utilize Express.js, a flexible Node.js web application framework, to handle routing and manage HTTP requests and responses.


## 7) Multiple Web Based Projects 🛠️

- **Project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** 🏗️
  - Explore my "Basic Project," a dynamic web application created with the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate these fundamental technologies to build a functional and visually appealing website.

  - **Key Features**:
    - Responsive design for various screen sizes.
    - Interactive user interface with JavaScript.
    - Stylish and modern user interface using CSS.
    - Smooth navigation and user experience.

  - **Technologies Used**:
    - HTML: Structuring the content.
    - CSS: Styling the layout and design.
    - JavaScript: Adding interactivity and functionality.

## 8) Quiz Manager Application 🧠🔧

Welcome to the Quiz Manager application, a backend solution created using Node.js and TypeScript. This powerful backend is designed to support a Quiz App, offering a range of features to enhance the quiz creation and participation experience.


## Key Features

- **Comprehensive REST APIs:** Explore a wide range of RESTful APIs that cover essential functionalities, including user registration, login, quiz creation, updates, deletions, and publishing.

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Learn about secure user management with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization, ensuring user data remains protected.

- **MongoDB Database:** Utilize MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for efficient data storage and retrieval, providing a seamless user experience.

- **Enhanced Learning:** This project offers an opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge of JWT implementation for user security, a crucial skill for building secure web applications.

- **REST API Architecture:** Understand the architecture of a REST API application, including routers, controllers, and models, for creating scalable and maintainable web applications.

### Usage

Here are some example API endpoints to get you started:

- `POST /api/users/register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /api/users/login`: Log in as an existing user.
- `POST /api/quizzes`: Create a new quiz.
- `PUT /api/quizzes/:quizId`: Update an existing quiz.
- `DELETE /api/quizzes/:quizId`: Delete a quiz.
- `GET /api/quizzes/:quizId`: Retrieve quiz details.
- `POST /api/quizzes/:quizId/publish`: Publish a quiz for participants.
